# Additional Materials by Rambler&Co

#### Rambler.iOS V - V is for VIPER

At Rambler&Co, iOS developer meetings are held periodically. One of them was entirely devoted to VIPER - and became the foundation for this book.

#### Rambler&IT

Theoretical materials are great, but one of the main problems we faced when getting acquainted with VIPER was the lack of examples of its application in applications more complex than the usual *Hello World*.

We tried to solve this issue and released the open source application [Rambler&IT](https://github.com/rambler-digital-solutions/RamblerConferences). Its main features:

- Divided into three main layers: `Presentation`, `BusinessLogic`, `Core`.
- The `Presentation` layer is entirely written using VIPER.
- The `BusinessLogic` layer is written using Service Oriented Architecture.
- The `Core` layer is written using the concept of compound operations, inspired by [session 226](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/226) WWDC 2015.
- Typhoon is actively used for Dependency Injection.

The application turned out to be quite large and complex and continues to actively develop. Currently, this is the most complete open example of using VIPER in a production project.

#### Other Conferences

Besides Rambler.iOS, we also talked about using VIPER at other conferences.

- VIPER - or what everyone talks about but no one explains ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGTdlNjh_5U) | [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/etolstoy/viper-ili-to-o-chiem-vsie-ghovoriat-no-nikto-nie-rasskazyvaiet)) - [Egor Tolstoy](https://github.com/igrekde)
