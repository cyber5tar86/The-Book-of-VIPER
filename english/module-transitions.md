# Module Transitions

## Introduction
In this module, we will discuss the various transitions between modules in the VIPER architecture. Understanding these transitions is crucial for maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.

## ViewController Approaches
There are several approaches to managing ViewControllers within VIPER:
1. **ViewController as a Presenter:** This approach uses the ViewController to handle user interactions and present data to the user.
2. **Presenter-Driven Navigation:** Here, the Presenter is responsible for navigation, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

## Configuration Blocks
Configuration blocks are closures that help in setting up ViewControllers with the necessary dependencies. This approach allows for a flexible and reusable code structure. You can define a configuration block when instantiating a ViewController, passing in the required parameters.

## Protocols
Protocols are essential in VIPER for defining the communication between modules. They ensure that the components of the architecture are loosely coupled and can be easily tested and maintained.

## ModuleInput/Output Approach with ViperMcFlurry
The ViperMcFlurry framework simplifies the implementation of the ModuleInput and ModuleOutput protocols. By using this framework, developers can focus on the core logic of their modules without worrying about boilerplate code. 

## Embed Segue Implementation
Embed segues allow for the seamless integration of ViewControllers within a parent ViewController. In VIPER, this can be done by using a dedicated Router that manages the creation and presentation of embedded ViewControllers, ensuring proper communication between them.

This approach enhances user experience by providing smooth transitions and maintaining a clean architecture.
